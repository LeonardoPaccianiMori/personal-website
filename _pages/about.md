I'm Leonardo Pacciani-Mori /leo&#39;nardo pa&#39;tʃːani &#39;mɔːri/, a postdoctoral researcher in the [Hwa lab](https://matisse.ucsd.edu/){:target="_blank"}<!--_--> at the University of California, San Diego.

I am a statistical physicist by training but I work at the interface of biological physics, microbial ecology and bacterial physiology. In particular, I study the constraints imposed by proteome allocation that bacteria have to satisfy in order to grow, and the effects that they have on population dynamics and the ecology of microbial communities.

<!--### Random fun facts
* My current [Erdős number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 3
* I have read the whole *In Search of Lost Time* by Marcel Proust during summer 2017-->

In case of an online meeting, the marker is located in the place where the meeting has been organized. Click any cluster to zoom and expand it.<!--, and use the layer control menu to select which category to show:--></p>

### As a network
<p>Below is a network representing my publications and collaborations; the color of each node specifies if it represents <span style="color:#1722C1">co-authors</span>, <span style="color:#90d185">preprints</span>, <span style="color:#138400">publications</span> or <span style="color:#8e20c1">theses</span> (in this case co-authors are supervisors). Hover and click on each node for more information, or drag them around to change the network's shape:</p>
